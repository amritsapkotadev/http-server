<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is basically a mini project showing one of the major ways in which HTTP servers are implemented. In summary, it uses a TCP socket to listen for incoming requests and sends back a basic HTTP response based on standards set by the [RFC documents](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/).

As previously mentioned, this implementation of an HTTP web server basically creates a TCP socket which:
* listens for incoming requests on a particular [socket address](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=addresses-socket-in-tcpip) (which is mostly a combination of an IP address and a network port)
* synchronously processes network connections from a queue of threads built up from the listening
* reads the message sent by a client over the network connection and sends some dummy HTTP response.

Of course, there are many many many ways in which this code can be improved and/or extended, so this is an **FYI** saying that this is mainly for educational purposes. Do not go off trying to build your own server from scratch for use within production-level projects. Asides from the obvious "try not to re-invent the wheel rhethoric", chances are (with almost a certainty) you will end up with very serious security-related problems.

### Built With


* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is a pretty simple project with just one requirement: 
* Docker (unless you want to build it manually, then you'd be needing C/C++ compiler).

### Prerequisites

You will need to have docker setup on your computer, which can be done fairly easily by following the steps on their [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). The version run with docker is the linux version of the HTTP server implementation.


### Building and Running

With docker fully setup on your system:

1. navigate to your desired project directory
2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kushalshah0/http-server.git
   ```
   (if you do not have git installed, take a brief detour and follow these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).
3. navigate to the project folder *__http-server/__* and build the docker image

   ```sh
   sudo docker-compose build
   ```
4. start the server
   ```sh
   sudo docker-compose up
   ```

When you're done with the server and need it shut down:

1. open up a second terminal window and navigate to the project folder

2. bring down the docker container

   ```sh
   sudo docker-compose down
   ```  
 **NOTE:** if you make any changes to the code, you will have to re-compile as well by simply running **step 3** again.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once your server is up and running with `docker-compose up`, you can pop into any web browser and navigate to `localhost:8080/` to see the default HTTP response sent from the server. There will be an article coming soon where I'll talk more indept about the development of this HTTP server.
